    <h1>This is the <i>best</i> motherfucking website.</h1>
    <p class='st'>Really, it is.</p>
    <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
    <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class='mfw'>motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default
        font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
    <p><span class='wr'>WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>
    <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    <p>Let me describe the <i>real</i> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class='mfw'>motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
        <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href='https://google.com/'>Google home page</a></li>
        <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
